# genes

[![CI](https://github.com/benmerckx/genes/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/benmerckx/genes/actions)

Generates split ES6 modules and Typescript definitions from Haxe modules.

Requires Haxe 4, status: experimental

## Usage

````
lix +lib genes
````

Install the library and add `-lib genes` to your hxml.


### Defines

- `-D dts` to generate Typescript definition files
- [`-debug`](https://haxe.org/manual/debugging-source-map.html) or [`-D js-source-map`](https://haxe.org/manual/debugging-source-map.html) to generate source maps
- [`-D source_map_content`](https://haxe.org/manual/debugging-source-map-javascript.html) to include source map contents
- `-D genes.unchanged_no_rewrite` don't write output files if there's no change 
  (compares output to file on disk)
- `-D genes.extern_init_warning` display a warning wherever an extern `__init__` 
  is used as these are not generated by genes
- `-D genes.disable` disable genes completely (eg. to compare results to default
  haxe js generator)
- `-D genes.no_extension` do not use the '.js' extension in import paths
- `-D genes.disable_native_accessors` do not generate native getter/setters for properties

### Metadata

- `@:genes.disableNativeAccessors` on class level or field level to disable generation of native getter/setters for properties


## Dynamic imports

```haxe
import genes.Genes.dynamicImport;
import my.module.A;
import my.module.B;
import my.module.C;
// ...
dynamicImport(A -> new A()).then(trace);

dynamicImport((B, C) -> [new B(), new C()]).then(trace);
```

Roughly translates to:

```js
import('./my/module/A')
  .then(({A}) => new A())
  .then(console.log)

Promise.all([import('./my/module/B'), import('./my/module/C')])
  .then(modules => [new modules[0].B(), new modules[1].C()])
  .then(console.log)
```

Genes expects a function declaration expression (`EFunction`) as the sole argument of `dynamicImport` and it will do 2 things:

1. For each argument, take the argument name (e.g. "MyClass") and resolve it as a type in the current context, taking Haxe `import` statements into account. This is for preparing the relative path of the target files (e.g. `'../../MyClass.js'`).
2. Type the function body in the current context, ignoring the fact that it is a function body. Thus in the example the scope of `A` is not the function argument but in current context i.e. the actual type `class A {...}`. The return type is then applied as the type parameter of `js.lib.Promise`. This is for hinting the return type of the `dynamicImport(...)` call so that the compiler can do its typing job properly.

## Upstream issues

- Performance could be much improved if we could use the compiler to output code.
  Haxe exposes methods to do so, but without a way to generate source maps for them.
  
  [HaxeFoundation/haxe#8625](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/8625)
- Typescript definitions are pretty much complete. In some cases though there will
  be references to non-existing types. Haxe does not pass any types that are 
  removed through DCE to the generation phase. However it does pass every typedef
  used in the project. This means sometimes a type (which it itself is not used)
  will reference a type that does not exist (removed by DCE).
  Luckily Typescript won't warn about these issues when your definitions are 
  included as a library but ideally we'd be able to output completely valid types.
